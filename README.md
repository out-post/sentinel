# ðŸ“– Sentinel (Bodyguard)

An experimental utilitarian and administration assistant for Discord server owners written in TypeScript.

## ðŸ›¡ Preamble

This bot aims to be an all-in-one solution for server owners, providing a variety of utilities and administration tools
to make server management easier. These features, whether implemented or on the roadmap, are listed below:

- Moderation tool suite: Commands, infraction system, censorship, and more.
- Raid prevention and verification.
- Server management tools: Customizable welcome messages, auto-role, etc.
- A revolutionary, intuitive and convenient way to manage the server through Groups.
- Other features: Key guild data & visualizations, fun commands, and more!

More advanced features are expected to diverge into Sentinel Guardian.

## ðŸ”§ Languages, Tools & Frameworks:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)
- [DiscordX](https://discordx.js.org/)

Guardian will not be suitable names to call this product anymore.
