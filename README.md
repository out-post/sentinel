## ðŸ¤” About...

### âœ… Branding

Sentinel is a brand name - **NOT THIS PRODUCT'S NAME**. This repository, and the product associated with it - is planned
to diverge into Sentinel Guardian and **be renamed** into Sentinel Bodyguard in 2024. Until then, "Sentinel" and "
Sentinel Bodyguard" are still suitable names for this product.

We are in **desperate need for a new logo.**

### ðŸªª Licensing

This project is licensed under a custom license made only for this bot. While it is not possible to redistribute the
code of this bot, we highly encourage you to clone this repository, make changes and improvements, and even self-host
your
own instance of Sentinel.

### ðŸ’» Contributing

Please feel free to make changes, improvements, and fixes to this repository. We are always open to new ideas ~~and are
planning to have a strike in mid-2024~~. Please make sure to follow
the [Code of Conduct](CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) before making
a pull request.

### ðŸ’‚ Bodyguard & ðŸ›¡ Guardian

Sentinel Bodyguard is planned to be kind of like a "Home Version", while Sentinel Guardian is expected to be a "Pro"
or "Enterprise Version" of sorts.
**IMPORTANT:** Despite what "Enterprise" sounds like, it will be completely free to use, with a few requirements before
using it. Sentinel Guardian is expected to be closed-source, however.
