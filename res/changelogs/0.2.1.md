# 0.2.1

Welcome to Sentinel, version 0.2.1!

***Warning**: This release is a **pre-alpha** release, meaning that it is not ready for production use. It is not
recommended to use this in a production environment, as it is still in active development and testing.*

Changes were mostly made to the development area *that is probably not important to casual users*:

- We now use Prettier and ESLint to keep our code clean and consistent.
- GitHub Actions! We now have a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and test the bot.

Other changes:

- The `/purge` command now is at a *(possibly)* final state. We put a lot of work and thought ~~and spaghetti code~~ in
  it. Enjoy having a clean chat!
- `/purge`'s precaution system now works **as expected**. Most of the spaghetti code and signs of overengineering we
  mentioned reside here.

That's all! Stay tuned for future updates of Sentinel!
