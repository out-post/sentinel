# ~~0.0.3~~ 0.1.0

***Warning**: This release is a **pre-alpha** release, meaning that it is not ready for production use. It is not
recommended to use this in a production environment, as it is still in active development and testing.*

Welcome to the "second update" of **Sentinel**...

**_Wait what?_**

That's right! TSentinel has been officially **rebranded** as **Sentinel**.

**_Why_**, you may ask? Well, this bot traces its origin back to a now-deleted repository from a guy named "Kisuzume",
whose bot was forked and modified by me.

We mutually decided to move all development efforts to my TypeScript codebase, for a number of reasons:

- The original codebase was written in JavaScript, ~~and JavaScript sucks~~ and it was getting hard _maneuvering around
  the language's inherent difficulty to debug_.
- Those difficulties meant that development was **dragging behind**, and it was taking **much more effort** to implement
  new features.
- The original codebase was also **not very well documented**, **a bit disorganized** and had heaps of spaghetti code.

Kudos to @Kisuzume for the original codebase, and for the inspiration to create this bot. Sorry for roasting your code
so hard.

**What's new?**

- Removed the cautionary warning from the changelog command. It gets _annoying_, I know.

Stay tuned for future updates of Sentinel!
