# 0.0.1

Welcome to the **first ever** release of TSentinel!

***Warning**: This release is a **pre-alpha** release, meaning that it is not ready for production use. It is not
recommended to use this in a production environment.*

What in the **_H-E-double-hockey-sticks_** does TSentinel even have right now? I dunno, slash commands I guess?

Here are those Slash Commands:

- `/ban`: Bans a user from the server, for when you don't feel like using the builtin `/ban` command.
- `/kick`: Kicks a user from the server, for when the default `/kick` _just isn't doing it for you_.
- `/purge`: Purges a number of messages from a channel, with multiple options for what to purge.
- And an `/about` command but we don't talk about that one.

Stay tuned until I have the courage to make this thing's GitHub repository public!
