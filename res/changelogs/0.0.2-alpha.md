# 0.0.2

Welcome to the **first ever** update of TSentinel!

**\*Warning**: This release is a **pre-alpha** release, meaning that it is not
ready for production use. It is not recommended to use this in a production
environment, as it is still in active development and testing.\*

A _small little_ quality-of-life update for TSentinel's changelogs: Introducing,
the `/changelog` command! Easily view the changelogs of the versions of
TSentinel, I guess.

Yeah. **_That's all._**
