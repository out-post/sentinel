# 0.3.0

Welcome to Sentinel, version 0.3.0!

_**Warning**: This release is a **pre-alpha** release, meaning that it is not ready for production use. It is not
recommended to use this in a production environment, as it is still in active development and testing._

Shh! Don't tell anyone that all commands have options related to silence and/or output suppression!

-   /ban and /kick now has a `silent` option to not DM the user that they have been banned, and a `suppress` option to
    not output anything!
-   Other commands that just emit information now by default is ephemeral, but can be made non-ephemeral with the
    `broadcast` option.

That's all! Stay tuned for future updates of Sentinel!
