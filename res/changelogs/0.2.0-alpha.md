# 0.2.0

Welcome to Sentinel, version 0.2.0!

**\*Warning**: This release is a **pre-alpha** release, meaning that it is not ready for production use. It is not
recommended to use this in a production environment, as it is still in active development and testing.\*

A major breaking change was made:

-   The `/purge` command cannot delete more than 100 messages at once. We thought we were **so smart** when we came up
    with the idea to work around the 100 cap.
-   Note to self, never try to workaround API rate-limits ever again.

That's all! Stay tuned for future updates of Sentinel!
